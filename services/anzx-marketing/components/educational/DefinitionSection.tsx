            <p>
              An <strong>AI agent</strong> is an intelligent software system that can perceive its environment, 
              make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that 
              follows pre-programmed instructions, AI agents can adapt, learn, and respond to new situations 
              autonomously.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of an AI agent as a digital employee that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and can 
              handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It combines the power of artificial intelligence with 
              the ability to interact with various systems, applications, and people to get work done.

            Simple Analogy: AI Agent as a Personal Assistant

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-600">
            <p>
              Imagine you have a highly capable personal assistant who:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Understands your preferences and goals</li>
              <li>Can communicate with anyone on your behalf</li>
              <li>Has access to all your business systems and data</li>
              <li>Works 24/7 without getting tired</li>
              <li>Learns from every interaction to get better</li>
              <li>Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That's essentially what an AI agent does for your business â€“ it acts as an intelligent, 
              always-available team member that can handle a wide range of tasks autonomously.
