# Language Switcher Fix

## Issue
The language dropdown wasn't working when trying to switch between English and Hindi.

## Root Cause
The routing logic in the LanguageSwitcher component wasn't properly handling the locale prefix in the URL path.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated LanguageSwitcher Component
- Added `useTransition` for smoother transitions
- Improved path parsing to correctly extract locale
- Added `router.refresh()` to ensure page updates
- Added disabled state during transition
- Better handling of edge cases

### 2. Created Alternative Link-Based Switcher
- Created `LanguageSwitcherLink.tsx` as a simpler alternative
- Uses Next.js Link component instead of router.push
- Shows the other language as a button (e.g., "हिंदी" when on English)
- More reliable for client-side navigation

## How to Test

### Option 1: Dropdown Switcher (Current)
1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Look for the language dropdown in the header (globe icon + dropdown)
3. Select "हिंदी" from dropdown
4. Page should reload with Hindi content at http://localhost:3002/hi
5. Select "English" to switch back

### Option 2: Link-Based Switcher (Alternative)
If the dropdown still doesn't work, you can switch to the link-based version:

In `components/layout/Header.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
<LanguageSwitcher />
```

With:
```tsx
<LanguageSwitcherLink />
```

This will show a button that toggles between languages.

## Expected Behavior

### English (Default)
- URL: `http://localhost:3002` or `http://localhost:3002/en`
- Content: All text in English
- Switcher shows: "हिंदी" option

### Hindi
- URL: `http://localhost:3002/hi`
- Content: All text in Hindi (Devanagari script)
- Switcher shows: "English" option

## Debugging

If it still doesn't work, check:

1. **Browser Console**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Check for any errors
   - Look for navigation logs

2. **Network Tab**
   - See if the page is actually navigating
   - Check the response URL

3. **Current Locale**
   - Add this to any page to see current locale:
   ```tsx
   const locale = useLocale();
   console.log('Current locale:', locale);
   ```

4. **Path Parsing**
   - Add console.log in LanguageSwitcher:
   ```tsx
   console.log('Current pathname:', pathname);
   console.log('Current locale:', locale);
   console.log('New path:', newPath);
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `components/ui/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` - Fixed routing logic
2. `components/ui/LanguageSwitcherLink.tsx` - Created alternative (NEW)
3. `components/layout/Header.tsx` - Imported both options

## Next Steps

1. Test the dropdown switcher
2. If it doesn't work, switch to link-based version
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Hindi translations are loading correctly

## Translation Files

Make sure these exist:
- `messages/en.json` ✅
- `messages/hi.json` ✅

## Middleware Configuration

The middleware is correctly configured to:
- Support locales: ['en', 'hi']
- Default locale: 'en'
- Locale prefix: 'as-needed' (English doesn't need /en prefix)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Dropdown changes but page doesn't reload
**Solution:** Added `router.refresh()` to force reload

### Issue: Wrong path after switching
**Solution:** Improved path parsing logic to handle edge cases

### Issue: Hindi font not showing
**Solution:** Already configured in layout.tsx with Noto Sans Devanagari

### Issue: Translations not loading
**Solution:** Check that messages/hi.json exists and is valid JSON
