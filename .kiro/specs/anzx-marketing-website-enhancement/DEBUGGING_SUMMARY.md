# Debugging Summary - ANZX Marketing Deployment

## Issue
Both https://anzx.ai and https://anzx.ai/cricket were showing blank pages in the browser with React hydration errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Initial Problem: Missing `trailingSlash`
- **Issue**: Next.js static export without `trailingSlash: true` creates `.html` files instead of directories with `index.html`
- **Impact**: Cloudflare Pages couldn't serve `/en` because it was looking for `/en/index.html` but only `/en.html` existed
- **Fix**: Added `trailingSlash: true` to `next.config.js`

### 2. Secondary Problem: `next-intl` Middleware with Static Export
- **Issue**: `next-intl` middleware tries to read `headers()` at runtime to detect locale
- **Impact**: Static export fails because middleware doesn't run during build time
- **Symptoms**: Pages show `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error in HTML
- **Fix**: Disabled middleware by setting `matcher: []` in `middleware.ts`

### 3. Tertiary Problem: `force-static` with `next-intl`
- **Issue**: Using `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in layout causes `next-intl` to fail
- **Impact**: Build errors about `headers()` usage
- **Fix**: Removed `force-static` and `dynamicParams` from layout

## Current State

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Static files generated in `out/` directory
- ‚úÖ Deployed to Cloudflare Pages: `https://b365e3a5.anzx-marketing.pages.dev`
- ‚úÖ Worker updated with correct environment variables

### Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HTML contains `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error alongside actual content
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a known limitation of `next-intl` with static export
- ‚úÖ Despite the error, components (`HomeHero`, `FeatureGrid`, etc.) are present in HTML
- üîç Need to verify if pages render correctly in browser despite the error

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `next.config.js` - Added `trailingSlash: true`
2. `middleware.ts` - Disabled middleware with `matcher: []`
3. `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Removed `force-static` and `dynamicParams`
4. All `app/[locale]/*/page.tsx` - Added `generateStaticParams()`

### Deployment URLs
- **Marketing Site**: https://b365e3a5.anzx-marketing.pages.dev
- **Cricket Chatbot**: https://6ded74f7.anzx-cricket.pages.dev
- **Cricket Agent API**: https://cricket-agent-aa5gcxefza-ts.a.run.app

### Worker Configuration
```javascript
env.CRICKET_AGENT_URL = "https://cricket-agent-aa5gcxefza-ts.a..."
env.CRICKET_CHATBOT_URL = "https://6ded74f7.anzx-cricket.pages.dev"
env.ANZX_MARKETING_URL = "https://b365e3a5.anzx-marketing.pages..."
```

### Routes
- `anzx.ai/cricket*` ‚Üí Cricket chatbot
- `anzx.ai/*` ‚Üí Marketing site (catch-all)
- `anzx.ai/_next/*` ‚Üí Next.js assets
- `anzx.ai/images/*` ‚Üí Images

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Cloudflare Pages Deployment
```bash
curl -I https://b365e3a5.anzx-marketing.pages.dev/en/
# Result: 200 OK
```

### 2. Check Worker Proxy
```bash
curl -I https://anzx.ai/en/
# Result: 200 OK (but HTML contains NEXT_NOT_FOUND)
```

### 3. Check HTML Content
```bash
curl -s https://anzx.ai/en/ | grep -o "HomeHero\|FeatureGrid\|NEXT_NOT_FOUND"
# Result: All three present (components + error)
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Accept Current State (Recommended)
- The pages contain both the error and the actual components
- Browser JavaScript might handle the hydration and render correctly
- Test in actual browser to verify

### Option 2: Remove `next-intl` Completely
- Replace with custom locale routing
- Use simple directory structure: `/en/*`, `/hi/*`
- No middleware needed
- More work but cleaner for static export

### Option 3: Use Different i18n Library
- Try `next-translate` or custom solution
- Libraries designed for static export
- Requires significant refactoring

## Recommendation

**Test the current deployment in a browser first.** Despite the `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error in the HTML source, the React components are present and might hydrate correctly. The error might only appear in the console without affecting the visual rendering.

If the pages render correctly in the browser, we can:
1. Accept the console errors as a known limitation
2. Add error boundary to suppress the errors
3. Document this as expected behavior

If the pages don't render, we'll need to pursue Option 2 or 3 above.

## Browser Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Test https://anzx.ai (should redirect to /en)
- [ ] Test https://anzx.ai/en (marketing homepage)
- [ ] Test https://anzx.ai/hi (Hindi homepage)
- [ ] Test https://anzx.ai/cricket (cricket chatbot)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify components render visually
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Test on mobile device

## Logs Checked

### Cloud Build Logs
- ‚úÖ Build step completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Pages deployment succeeded
- ‚úÖ Worker deployment succeeded
- ‚úÖ All routes configured correctly

### Cloudflare Worker Logs
- No real-time logs available (tail not configured)
- Worker is proxying requests correctly (200 OK responses)

### Cloudflare Pages Logs
- Deployment successful
- Files uploaded: 97 files (63 already cached)
- Deployment URL: https://b365e3a5.anzx-marketing.pages.dev

## Conclusion

The deployment is technically successful - all infrastructure is working correctly. The issue is a `next-intl` + static export compatibility problem that results in `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` errors in the HTML. However, the actual component code is present in the HTML, so the pages might still render correctly in the browser.

**Action Required**: User needs to test in actual browser with cache cleared to determine if visual rendering works despite the HTML errors.
