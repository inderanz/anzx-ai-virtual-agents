# ANZx.ai Platform

Advanced AI assistants, freeing up human entrepreneurs to focus on strategic work.

## Platform Overview

At its core, the ANZx.ai platform is a sophisticated, multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution designed to empower businesses ("customers") to build and deploy their own advanced AI virtual agents. These agents are then made available to the business's own users ("end-customers") through an embeddable chat widget.

The architecture is built on a modern microservices stack, leveraging Python/FastAPI for the backend, a lightweight JavaScript for the frontend chat widget, and Google's Vertex AI for the intelligence layer. The entire system is designed for cloud-native deployment, particularly on Google Cloud Platform.

### How the ANZx.ai Platform Works

The platform facilitates a seamless flow of information from a business's private data to an end-user's chat query.

1.  **Onboarding & Setup**: A business (your customer) signs up and logs into the platform via the `auth-frontend`.
2.  **Knowledge Ingestion**: The customer uploads their business documents or provides website URLs through a dashboard (powered by your `core-api`). The Knowledge Management System kicks in:
    *   It extracts text from these sources.
    *   It breaks the text into smaller, meaningful chunks.
    *   It converts these chunks into numerical representations (vector embeddings) via the Vertex AI Embeddings API.
    *   These embeddings are stored in the database, creating a searchable "brain" for that specific customer.
3.  **Agent Configuration**: The customer configures their AI agent, defining its purpose and linking it to the newly created knowledge base.
4.  **End-User Interaction**: An end-user visits the customer's website and asks a question in the `chat-widget`.
5.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Action**:
    *   The `chat-widget` sends the question to the `core-api`.
    *   The API performs a semantic search over the vector database to find the most relevant text chunks from the customer's documents that relate to the end-user's question. This is the **Retrieval** step.
    *   The API then sends the original question along with the retrieved text chunks as context to the Google Vertex AI agent.
    *   The agent uses this context to formulate a relevant, accurate, and natural-sounding answer. This is the **Generation** step.
    *   The final answer, often with citations pointing to the source documents, is sent back to the chat widget and displayed to the end-user.

### How Your Customers Will Use It

Your customers (businesses, entrepreneurs) will experience the platform as a powerful tool to automate customer support and engagement.

1.  **Login**: They will start by signing into their account through the `auth-frontend`.
2.  **Create a Knowledge Base**: They will upload their internal documentation, FAQs, product catalogs, and policy documents. This is a "train once, use forever" model where they provide the raw knowledge.
3.  **Deploy the Agent**: They will copy a simple JavaScript snippet for the chat widget and paste it into their website's HTML.
4.  **Monitor & Manage**: Through a future dashboard, they would be able to view conversation histories, analyze the types of questions being asked, and monitor usage for billing purposes.

### How End-Customers Will Benefit and Use It

The end-customers (visitors to your customers' websites) will receive the most direct benefit:

1.  **Instant Support**: They can ask questions and get immediate, 24/7 answers directly on the website, without waiting for a human agent.
2.  **Accurate Information**: Because the AI's answers are grounded in the company's own documents, the information is trustworthy and specific to that business. For example, they can ask "What is your return policy for items bought on sale?" and get a precise answer, not a generic one.
3.  **Natural Conversation**: They will interact with the chat widget just like they would with a human, using natural language. They can ask follow-up questions and have a coherent conversation.

In essence, you have built a robust platform that allows any business to create a powerful, knowledgeable AI assistant, dramatically improving their customer service capabilities and freeing up their human team to focus on more strategic work.

## Architecture

The ANZx.ai platform is built as a cloud-native microservices architecture with the following components.

### Services

- **Core API** (`services/core-api/`) - FastAPI service handling authentication, billing, and core business logic.
- **Agent Orchestration** (`services/agent-orchestration/`) - AI agent management and conversation routing.
- **Knowledge Service** (`services/knowledge-service/`) - Document processing, embeddings, and RAG system.
- **Chat Widget** (`services/chat-widget/`) - Embeddable JavaScript widget for customer interactions.
- **Auth Frontend** (`services/auth-frontend/`) - Customer-facing login portal.

### Service Responsibilities

Each microservice has a distinct role in the platform's operation:

-   **`auth-frontend`**: A lightweight React application that provides the customer-facing login portal. It integrates with Firebase Authentication to handle Google sign-ins and exchanges the Firebase token for a platform-specific JWT from the Core API.

-   **`core-api`**: The central nervous system of the platform. Its responsibilities include:
    -   **Authentication & Authorization**: Validating JWTs and securing endpoints.
    -   **Business Logic**: Managing organizations, users, billing, and subscriptions.
    -   **Knowledge Pipeline**: Handling document uploads (to Cloud Storage), orchestrating text extraction, chunking, and triggering embedding generation via Vertex AI.
    -   **RAG Execution**: Receiving queries from the chat widget, performing vector searches against the PostgreSQL database, and calling the Vertex AI agent with the retrieved context.
    -   **API Gateway**: Serving as the primary endpoint for both the `auth-frontend` and the `chat-widget`.

-   **`chat-widget`**: A vanilla JavaScript application designed for maximum compatibility and performance. It gets embedded on the customer's website. Its job is to capture end-user messages, display the conversation history, and communicate with the `core-api` in real-time using WebSockets (with an HTTP fallback).

-   **`agent-orchestration` & `knowledge-service`**: In the current architecture, the core logic for these functions resides within the `core-api` to simplify deployment. Their names reflect the logical separation of concerns, with future potential to be spun out into their own dedicated services as the platform scales.

### Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL with pgvector** - Primary database with vector embeddings support.
- **Redis** - Caching and message queuing.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerized development and deployment.

## System Architecture and Live Status Analysis

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the ANZX.ai Platform project, based on a review of the codebase, infrastructure-as-code, and live GCP deployment status as of September 21, 2025.

### Service Configurations & Connections

1.  **Chat Widget (`chat-widget`):**
    *   **Role:** The user-facing interface. It's a vanilla JavaScript application that can be embedded on any website.
    *   **Connection:** It initiates a WebSocket connection to the Core API (`/api/chat-widget/ws/{widget_id}`) for real-time communication. If WebSockets fail, it falls back to standard HTTP polling to the same API (`/api/chat-widget/public/chat`). All communication is with the Core API.

2.  **Core API (`core-api`):**
    *   **Role:** The central nervous system. It manages authentication, user data, billing, and acts as a secure gateway to the other backend services. It is the only service the user's browser directly communicates with.
    *   **Connections:**
        *   **Receives requests from:** The Chat Widget.
        *   **Cloud SQL (Postgres):** Connects to the database to manage user, organization, and assistant data.
        *   **Redis:** Used for caching sessions and other ephemeral data.
        *   **Agent Orchestration:** When a chat message requires an AI-powered response, the Core API forwards the request to the appropriate endpoint on the Agent Orchestration service (e.g., `/orchestrate/support`).

3.  **Knowledge Service (`knowledge-service`):**
    *   **Role:** The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. It does not receive requests directly from the user or Core API during a chat. Its primary role is asynchronous document processing.
    *   **Connections & AI Usage:**
        *   **Receives requests from:** An administrator or system process that uses its `/documents` endpoint to upload files.
        *   **Cloud Storage:** Stores the original uploaded documents (PDFs, etc.) for archival.
        *   **`sentence-transformers`:** Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to convert chunks of text into 384-dimension vector embeddings.
        *   **Cloud SQL (Postgres w/ `pgvector`):** Stores the text chunks and their corresponding vector embeddings in the `document_chunks` table.
        *   **Provides data to:** The Agent Orchestration service via its `/search` endpoint.

4.  **Agent Orchestration (`agent-orchestration`):**
    *   **Role:** The "brain" that constructs AI responses. It executes a logical sequence of steps to answer a user's query.
    *   **Connections & AI Usage:**
        *   **Receives requests from:** The Core API.
        *   **Knowledge Service:** It makes an HTTP POST request to the Knowledge Service's `/search` endpoint, sending the user's query. The Knowledge Service performs a vector similarity search and returns the most relevant text chunks as "context".
        *   **Vertex AI (`langchain_google_vertexai`):** After retrieving context, it constructs a detailed prompt containing both the original question and the retrieved context. It then sends this prompt to a Google Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-pro`) via the Vertex AI API to generate a final, context-aware answer.
        *   **LangGraph:** This framework defines the sequence of operations: `retrieve_context` -> `generate_response` -> `END`.
